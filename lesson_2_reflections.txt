Add lesson 2 reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize it creates untracked files. You need to do it so that you can
	create commits and modify versions.

How is the staging area different than the working directory and repository? What value do
you think it offers?

	The staging area gives you the chance to review and reflect on your work before moving
	it to the working directory and repository. It allows you to pause before making a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By reviewing your files and changes in the staging area and deciding what you'd like to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would
branches help?

	When you're making slight changes, branches are helpful by keeping the master intact, but allowing
	for experimental changes that you may want to build on.
